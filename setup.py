"""
setup.py - Package Installation Script.

This module contains the setuptools configuration for installing the Python package.
It uses the `setup` function from the setuptools module to define package metadata,
dependencies, and other configuration details.

Note: The use of `from __future__ import annotations` is included to support postponed
evaluation of type annotations, which became the default behavior starting from Python 3.7.

For more information on setuptools and package distribution,
refer to the official documentation:
